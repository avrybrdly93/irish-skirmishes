# Irish Skirmishes

Based in the streets of Ireland, Irish Skirmishes a text-based game currently being developed by avrybrdly93 for fun.  The player moves throughout the map by using their arrow keys, and each movement provides them the opportunity to find new items and add to their inventory.  The player can then use these items to change their players stats, turn in quests, or sell for coins.  The plan is to create this as a multiplayer game where characters can interact with each other.
